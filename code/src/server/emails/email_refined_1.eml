Dear Loan Servicing Team,

I have an outstanding balance on my loan and would like to make a partial pre=
payment. Before proceeding, I need clarification on any applicable charges.

- Loan Account Number: CB223344
- Prepayment Amount: $50,000
- Preferred Payment Date: April 10, 2025

Additionally, I would like to understand if making this payment will have any=
 impact on my monthly installment schedule.

Thanks,
Andrew Cooper
